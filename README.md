clipping bad, maximizing good!

Trying to determine low frequency clipping. Being able to compare with the amplifier voltage rail would be nice, but with consumer amplifiers many times that isn't an option. Also, this wouldn't indicate if the audio was clipped in production and I don't want any clipped audio going through my speakers. I would like a analog solution, but at this point I'm leaning toward a digital solution due to the constraints. Let me know what you think.
